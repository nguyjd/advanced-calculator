# Advanced Calculator

A calculator that can parse advanced questions/equation and solve it.
This program is inspired from [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/).

However, this program takes nothing from the website itself.
I made this program to test my understanding in programming, logic, and mathematics

The program is developed and used on Windows 10
